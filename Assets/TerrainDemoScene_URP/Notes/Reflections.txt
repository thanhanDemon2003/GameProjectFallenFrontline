In this scene we've opted to use standard Unity [Reflection_Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ReflectionProbe.html) to provide the appearance of reflections on the lake surface.  

You can express more sophisticated reflections using Shadergraph's custom lighting and Unity's custom script, but for the visual with HDRP samples, it was simply expressed as a reflection probe.
